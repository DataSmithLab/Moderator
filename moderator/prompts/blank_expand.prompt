I now have a structure describing a certain content: [obj: '', sty: '', act: ''] In the structure: 
    - The obj context describes certain objects or entities in the moderated content.
    - The sty context describes harmful styles of moderated content. 
    - The act context describes the action or activity the obj context takes. 
You need to expand the missing variables of this content's context. Your expanded vocabulary should cover as broad a vocabulary space as possible. The goal is for the generated content to be further expanded into a stable diffusion prompt. For {expand_key}, you need to expand {expand_num}. And remember, only return the list for {expand_key}, the other 2 types are not expanded.
Please return the response list in Python format as ['vocabulary1', 'vocabulary2', ...]. Not any addtional words are permitted.
